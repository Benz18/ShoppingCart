# ShoppingCart
Design of a shopping cart with the use of ASP.NET MVC language in a team of four (School Project)

The objective of this project is to demonstrate mastery on ASP.NET MVC by creating a Shopping Cart web application.

Assume that the users who are purchasing have already registered with the system and that all users’ credentials are stored in the database (passwords must be hashed in the database and client should not send the user’s password in the clear).

Each product, of a purchase, has a unique activation-code tied to a user. If a user purchased two products, he will be provided with 2 activation-codes even if the two products are the same.
